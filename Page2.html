            <h3>Hobbies</h3>

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like some games like <span id="enfisisIsOntheGame"><strong>Nazi Zombies in COD</strong> </span>3 and 4 or multiplayer.
                I like to do some puzzles and simple DIYs.
                I also like to play some YU-GI-OH duels.
                Drawing is another thing I like to do. Not often but I do put in some time when I have it.
                Building is another thing that I enjoy doing, as you can be proud of what you just built.
                Playing cards is also a good hobby I do.
                I also like to lay down on my bed and read for a while.

    <h3>Current Up Keep</h3>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I hung out with one of my Best Friends. We played some T.H.U.G. (Tony Hawks Underground), had our ramen noodle ritual, 
        and then we just watched some memes and funny videos.
        Last week at church we played a big game of keep away ball and I ran like all hell was loose and I got really tired and my lungs hurt so much, 
        my hand also stung because of all the spiking I did.
        My holloween plans arn't fully made up as of now, but I plan to do somthing fun. This weekend my mom should be free to cut my hair, 
        witch i'm probualy just goning to have it cut shorter again but I might find a new look that I like you never know. 
        Some of my projects are moving along but I plan to pick up the pace just slightly. 
        I got to see and talk with my grandma for a bit this morning that was a bit nice.
