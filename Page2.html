    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first goal is to take my drivers test to get my permit, to later on get my drivers license.
        My next goal is to find a job that I like and can get to. Eventualy I hope to get married to a lovingly wife and make a happy family.
        Another goal I want to complete is to learn how to play the guitar, the drums, and  a paino. 
        I would also like to get back into gaming again as who dosen't like to play a game from time to time.
        After either building my house or buying it I will make a personal library for my family to use and expand. 
        My next goal would be to get into a better shape, so I can be as healthy as a horse.

    <h3>Current Up Keep</h3>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I hung out with one of my Best Friends. We played some T.H.U.G. (Tony Hawks Underground), had our ramen noodle ritual, 
        and then we just watched some memes and funny videos.
        Last week at church we played a big game of keep away ball and I ran like all hell was loose and I got really tired and my lungs hurt so much, 
        my hand also stung because of all the spiking I did.
        My holloween plans arn't fully made up as of now, but I plan to do somthing fun. This weekend my mom should be free to cut my hair, 
        witch i'm probualy just goning to have it cut shorter again but I might find a new look that I like you never know. 
        Some of my projects are moving along but I plan to pick up the pace just slightly. 
        I got to see and talk with my grandma for a bit this morning that was a bit nice.
